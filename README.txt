About dataset
The dataset contains:
* 2 classes (Malignant, Benign), 
* 32 rows, 569 columns
* Class distribution (357 Benign, 212 malignant)
* No missing attributes

Python Requirements

Anaconda: To run this code, it is recommended that you have Anaconda installed on your computer. If you don’t you can download it from the link provided below,
Link: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
Jupyter Notebook orJupyterLab: Once you’ve installed anaconda, launch either Notebook or Lab, then open the python file.
Alternatively, if you want to run this file directly on python or any other python application (e.g. PyCharm, MacPorts…), make sure to use python version 3.5 or above.
Anaconda’s latest version uses python version 3.7, so it is preferable to use it to run the codes.

Libraries
To run this code, you need to install additional libraries; from anaconda navigator,
Anaconda terminal
First install Graphvis using the line “pip install graphvis” , the install pydotplus “pip install pydotplus”
Search Packages
Search for graphvis and pydotplus, once found select them and click apply. 

Run codes
Once you’ve opened the python code on Jupyter, you are ready to run the codes. 
If you downloaded the dataset, replace the file location with yours. If you did not download it, you can load it directly from Kaggle. 

For the best experience run the codes cell by cell to see each output.
